# Synth Effect

Synth Effect is a visual synthesizer written for my own VJing purposes. It's a stack of SDL2, OpenCV, and RTMIDI.
At this point I am not expecting others to use it.

## Installation

This project dependds on opencv >= 3.4.1 built with the [contrib modules](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib). This is left as an exercise left to the reader.

You will also need SDL2 and RTMIDI. Maybe you can install that with the following:

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y librtmidi-dev libsdl2-dev libboost-all-dev
```

After installing dependencies (sdl2, opencv 3, and rtmidi):

```
$ touch *
$ ./configure
$ make 
$ make install
```

## Personal Notes

To make on MacOS:

```
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig make
```

Or just set that variable so you don't have to keep including it to make.
